In 2020, I was in a cab leaving the Square office in SF, where I'd just completed interviewing for a "macOS CI Site Reliability Engineer" role. In that cab, I was told that AWS was secretly developing a product that would allow running Apple hardware directly in EC2. Just a couple of hours prior, my soon-to-be manager and I had discussed the possibility of shifting Square's self-hosted datacenter Mac CI cluster to some other colo vendor or cloud provider.

AWS [announced EC2 Mac](https://youtu.be/AaYNwOh90Pg?t=2169) at re:Invent 2020 later that year, timed with [Apple's own press release](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=swfemvx0). Apple had just released Big Sur with a new addition to its macOS Licensing Terms and Conditions: a [section about a 24-hour minimum lease period](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/12/apple-outlines-device-and-software-leasing-in-macos-big-sur-licensing-agreement).

Fast-forward exactly *four years*, and this past week I had the pleasure of speaking at [AWS re:Invent 2024](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) in Las Vegas alongside one of the primary instigators of EC2 Mac, Manish Rathaur.

In this session (CMP210), I detail [Block's](https://block.xyz/) migration from a self-managed Mac CI cluster to EC2 Mac. You can check out the video recording of the session below!
