I'm proud to have attended _all but one_ of the six [MacDevOpsYVR](https://mdoyvr.com/) conferences, normally held in Vancouver, Canada. I was looking forward to being there in person this year but am grateful that the crew has kept it going virtually this year!

Today I'm giving a talk on Python delivery to Mac clients. You can grab the slides and video recording on the [talks]({{< relref "/page/talks.md" >}}) page. Here are links to things referenced in the talk:
